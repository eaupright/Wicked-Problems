# Project 5 Part 1: Acquiring, Modifying, and Describing Land Use and Land Cover Data

For this project, I retrieved land use and cover data from the WorldPop website. With this data, I then described and analyzed Bosnia and Herzegovina by creating several density histograms with population and other land use variables as the dependent variables. I also used this data to describe Bosnia and Herzegovina by creating regressions that show the correlation between population, and land use and land cover variables.


### Histograms:

Very similar to the histogram with night time light, this plot has most municipalities concentrated on left, with little urban land cover.
