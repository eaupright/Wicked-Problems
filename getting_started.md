# Getting Started Assignments: Line Plots

The first assignment was to use R & Rstudio to create a simple line plot and another, more complicated plot.

### The first, simple line plot:

I created the line plot by assigning values to two objects, one named "x" and the other "y". Then, after plotting the objects, I added a title and labels to the plot. Finally, I customized the graph by using arguments to change the linetype, lineweight, color, point symbol, and point symbol scale.
