# Elizabeth Upright: Wicked Problems 

<img src="wmpicture.jpg" width="200" height="222" />

Hello! My name is Elizabeth Upright, and this is my repository for the course, Wicked Problems. I am a freshman at William & Mary, and I will be a pole vaulter on the Track & Field team. Along with doing sports, I enjoy playing with my cats, cooking, and doing puzzles. I am currently undecided on a major, but data science seems like an interesting field to explore.
