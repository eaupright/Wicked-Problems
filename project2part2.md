# Project 2 Part 2: Using the Stock Market to Describe, Analyze, & Predict

For this part of the project, I used the "quantmod" package to retrieve and analyze data about companies that are currently being traded on the stock market. With this package, I collected stock data from the internet from five different companies: Fannie Mae, Home Depot, Zillow, Lowes, and D.R.Horton. Then, using this data, I created several models to predict the closing price of Fannie Mae tomorrow based on the closing price today of the other stocks. I then plotted these models as matrices to visualize the relationships between the stocks.
