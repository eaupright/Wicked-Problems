# Data Science Reflection #4: Delve by Sidewalk Labs

Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet Inc. subsidiary that works to increase sustainability and affordability in cities, has developed a new piece of design software called Delve. Delve works to help architects, developers, and planners by producing millions of design possibilities for different urban developments. By using machine learning, Delve can produce urban design options based on certain criteria inputted by developers, including budget restrictions, daylight access, leasable area, gross floor area, open space, and more. 

To create Delve, Sidewalk Labs first made a model based on core components that are found across nearly all city neighborhoods. This model included buildings, streets, open spaces, amenities, and energy infrastructure. Then, they applied machine learning to this model so that Delve would be able to create and evaluate millions of designs based on the project’s priority outcomes. Delve will also rank the best design options it produces, providing a report for each design on how well it fulfills the project’s brief. 

Sidewalk Labs then tested their software with Quintain to produce designs for a 12-acre development on the North East Lands parcel in Wembley Park, London. Quintain is a real-estate development company based in the U.K. who has struggled to come up with cost-effective designs for this plot of land that provide enough housing units while still retaining sufficient daylight hours. After applying the project’s inputs, constraints, and priority outcomes, Delve created and identified 24 designs that outperformed Quintain’s previous designs on multiple levels. Delve was able to increase the number of housing units, amount of open space, daylight access, and sun hours. Thus, increasing the profitability of the parcel and improving the quality of life. 


This is an example of what the software looks like from its application to the North East Lands parcel:
