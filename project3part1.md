# Project 3 Part 1: Projecting, Plotting, and Labeling Administrative Subdivisions

For this project, I evaluated shapefile data from GADM and geoBoundaries about Bosnia and Herzegovina. With this data, I plotted the international boarder, entities/district, cantons, and municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

### Deliverables:

This plot shows the international boarder, entities/district, and cantons in Bosnia and Herzegovina from data collected from GADM. However, I did some research and found that only the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has offical cantons, so I do not know what the ADM-2 divisions in the Republika Srpska represent.

For this plot, I used data from geoBoundaries to plot the ADM-0, ADM-1, and ADM-2 boundaries. Compared to the data I got from GADM, the international boarder and the boaders for the entities and district are the same. However, the data stored in ADM-2 varied across platforms. From geoBoundaries, this data represented the boarders of the municipalities. On the other hand, in the data from GADM, ADM-2 held the data for the canton boarders while ADM-3 held the data for the municipalities.

### Stretch Goals:

This plot shows a closer view of one of the most populous cantons in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina - Sarajevo. Sarajevo contains nine municipalities and it also holds the capital city, Sarajevo.

Finally, this plot shows more detailed maps of the two most populous cantons in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina - Sarajevo and Tuzla. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the two entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have different administrative subdivisions, it was difficult to find a proper comparision for population densities. Therefore, I just stuck to comparing the populations of the ten cantons in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
