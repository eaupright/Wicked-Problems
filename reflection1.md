# Data Science Reflection #1: Climax Foods

Thereâ€™s a new start-up company, Climax Foods, that is basing its work in food, data science, and machine learning. Their goal is to redefine the future of food by creating plant-based food replications that are as delicious as their animal-product counterparts. The company hopes that their discoveries will reduce climate change by eliminating the need for the incredibly wasteful animal industry. The founder, Oliver Zahn, is bringing in processes from data science and machine learning to accomplish these goals.

Climax Foods is creating machine learning algorithms to process plant proteins and molecular structures. With these algorithms, they will be able to locate the plant-based molecules that best match up with those in animal-based foods. They will also be using machine learning to model the results of combining different proteins with certain carbohydrates or fats. The models will then take the resulting molecules and be able to predict their textures, smells, or functionality as a food. By using these data science methods and machine intelligence, Climax Foods can streamline the formulation process, hopefully bringing their products to shelves within a few years. 

The first food Climax has started tackling is cheese, and already, they have produced many prototypes that have held up well in blind taste testing. However, Zahn believes that they can still make many improvements. Ideally, with the use of their machine learning techniques, Climax Foods will be able to convert consumers who love the flavors, textures, and price points of typical animal products.
